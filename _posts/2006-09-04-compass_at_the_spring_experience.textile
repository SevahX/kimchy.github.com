title: Compass at The Spring Experience
---

I will be presenting Compass at <a href="http://www.thespringexperience.com/speaker_topic_view.jsp?topicId=287">The Spring Experience</a> in Florida. It sounds like it is going to be a great conference and I can't wait to go to the states and meet some of the American Compass users. If you are going to go to the conference and want to catch up just send me an email or try to find me out. I will probably add a Manhattan buffer to the trip, so if you want to catch up there for a beer or two just leave me an email or a comment and we can arrange something.
