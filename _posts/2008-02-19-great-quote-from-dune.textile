title: Great quote from Dune
---

p. I am reading the wonderful <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_(novel)">Dune</a> book again and wanted to share the following quote:

bq. Many have marked the speed with which the Muad'Dib learned the necessities of Arrakis. The Bene Gesserit, of course, know the basis of the speed. For the others, we can say that Muad'Dib learned rapidly because his first training was in how to learn. And the first lesson of all was the basic trust that he could learn. It is shocking to find how many people do not believe they can learn, and how many more believe learning to be difficult. Muad'Dib knew that every experience carries a lesson.

p. So true...
