p. The main focus of Compass 1.2 is going to revolve around the up coming Lucene 2.1 release. Other minor features and user driven requirements will also find their way into Compass (as usual).



p. Compass is really taking off, with an ever expanding user base and very active community on the forum. Thanks for everybody who helped make 1.1 happen (and this include helping on the forum, which frees me to implement new features :) ).
