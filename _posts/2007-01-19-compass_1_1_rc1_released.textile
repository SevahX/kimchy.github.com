	<ul>
		<li>**Parallel Gps Index Operation**: Most Gps devices (Hibernate, JPA, ...) now support automatic parallel index execution within the same JVM. More information can be found <a href="http://jroller.com/page/kimchy?entry=parallel_indexing_in_compass">here</a>.</li>
		<li>**Cascading Support**: Compass support cascading operation on component and reference mappings. More information can be found <a href="http://jroller.com/page/kimchy?entry=cascades_and_compass">here</a>.</li>
		<li>**Terms list of Properties**: Compass now allows to get a list of all the terms for a property name including its frequencies within the index. This feature allow to simplify the implementation of "popular tag listing" as can be seen in different blogs and tagging sites.</li>
