title: Show Me The Money - Arizona Cardinals
---

F###ing Arizona. These words sum up the football playoffs for me. If I could, I would have summed it up by writing it ten times and thats it. That is how much Arizona getting to the Super Bowl is amazing to me. Its not only that Arizona club are the losers of American sport, that gets for the first time to the Super Bowl (it was bound to happen one time or the other), but its the way it was achieved. The same cardinals that barely won 9 games in the regular season (6 of them in the pathetic NFC west), and got smashed by any respectable team, 56 from the Giants, 48 from the Eagles, 47 from the Patriots, they became a completely different team in the playoffs. 3 weeks that Arizona is playing the best football in the NFC. In contrast with the regular season, where they only showed good offense once in a while, in the playoffs, defense decided to show up and even the running game raised its head here and there.

You can't help but rooting for them!. Go Cardinals!.
