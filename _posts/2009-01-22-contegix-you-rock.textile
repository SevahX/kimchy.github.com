title: Contegix - You Rock
---

<a href="http://www.contegix.com/">Contegix</a>, the hosting company that host <a href="http://www.compass-project.org">Compass</a> and many other open source projects  and commercial companies simply rocks. The level of knowledge, the response time, and the readiness to always help, is simply amazing. 

And to top that, this is what I got yesterday:

Thanks!
