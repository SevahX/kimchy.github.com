title: TSS Prague
---

p. TSS at Prague was great. Great sessions, always great meeting up with people from all over the world. Sadly, I did not manage to get to too many sessions, had to work a bit on GigaSpaces upcoming 6.5 GA release, but the ones I went to were really good.



p. I also did a tech talk with Jason Carriera. I was talking about next generation application servers and Jason was talking about his experience working with GigaSpaces (he is working on a really cool app, I won't spoil the surprise) and also about the <a href="http://www.openspaces.org">OpenSpaces</a> developer contest where he won the third place.



p. I also gave a presentation titled "Beyond a Data Grid" where I try to talk about things that can be done with a DataGrid beyond your typical Cache#put and Cache#get mainly through examples. Here is the presentation (mostly pictures, but still ;) ):
