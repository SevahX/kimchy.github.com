title: A (first) Baby Girl Has Arrived
---

p. It took ages but she is finally here, my first born baby girl (did not know the sex beforehand, I was sure it would be a boy, though happy cause wife wanted a girl. here goes my psychic powers). Living in a high state of total bliss and extreme sleep deprivation. Trying to solve the latter by drinking large quantities of wine (so I can get to sleep) which enhance the former, a vicious cycle :).
