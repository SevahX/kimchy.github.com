title: Compass - Index and Search Session
---

Compass has the concept of a __CompassSession__, which is created using the __Compass__ instance and then used to perform indexing operation (create/save/delete) and search/read operations. In the upcoming 2.2 M2, two sub types of the __CompassSession__ can now be used. The __CompassIndexSession__ for indexing purposes, and the __CompassSearchSesssion__ for search/read purposes. This can simplify a bit the usage of different sessions (less code complete clutter) , as well as allow for some optimizations to be made when choosing a specific session.


Here is how the indexing session can be used:

{% highlight java %}
CompassIndexSession session = compass.openIndexSession();
try {
    session.save(author);
    session.delete(Author.class, 2);
    session.create(book);
    session.commit();
} catch (Exception e) {
    session.rollback();
}
{% endhighlight %}

And here is how the search session can be used:

{% highlight java %}
CompassSearchSession session = compass.openSearchSession();
try {
    CompassHits hits = session.find("jack london");
    // ...
} finally {
    session.close();
}
{% endhighlight %}

Enjoy!.
