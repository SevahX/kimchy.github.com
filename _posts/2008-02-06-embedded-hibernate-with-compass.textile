title: Embedded Hibernate with Compass
---

p. Up until now, the integration of <a href="http://www.compass-project.org/docs/1.2.1/reference/html/gps-hibernate.html">Compass with Hibernate</a> was nice, but not as nice as it should be. With the latest 2.0 M1 release, Compass now supports embedded mode with Hibernate, similar to the integration it has with <a href="http://www.compass-project.org/docs/1.2.1/reference/html/gps-embeddedopenjpa.html">OpenJPA</a>.

p. So, how does it work? Very simply. Within the hibernate configuration, simply add a single property pointing to where Compass will store the index:

<pre lang="xml" line="1">
<hibernate-configuration>
    <session-factory>
        <!-- Other hibernate mappings and proeprties -->      
  
        <property name="compass.engine.connection">target/test-index</property>
    </session-factory>
</hibernate-configuration>
</pre>

This will cause Compass to start within Hibernate, automatically add all the searchable Hibernate mapped classes, and start mirroring Hibernate changes to the search engine.

Now, in order to a Compass instance in order to perform searches, you can simply get it from the Hibernate session factory:

<pre lang="java" line="1">
Compass compass = HibernateHelper.getCompass(sessionFactory);
</pre>

That simplifies things, no? :). For full reference documentation, read <a href="http://www.compass-project.org/docs/2.0M1/reference/html/gps-embeddedhibernate.html">here</a>.
